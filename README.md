# HR-Department-Analytics
**Goal**
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive overview of the employee information by leveraging the power of data visualization. By presenting the information in a visually compelling manner, this dashboard aims to simplify complex data and enable users to make data-driven decisions more effectively.

**Problem Statement:**
The HR department has the task of overseeing and controlling different aspects of employee information in order to ensure the organization maintains a strong and productive workforce. However, there is a problem with the absence of specific performance indicators that can be used to monitor and analyze important HR metrics. Consequently, it is necessary to create and put into effect a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to address the following issues:
1. Employee Count
2. Attrition Count
3. Attrition Rate
4. Active Employees
5. Average Age
